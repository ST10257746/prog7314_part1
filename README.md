## Purpose

The primary goal of FitTrackr is to empower users to take control of their fitness journey. The app allows users to:

- Maintain a **workout library** with pre-defined exercises.
- Start and track workout sessions with real-time metrics including **time, heart rate, and calories burned**.
- Monitor **nutrition** intake and set dietary goals.
- Set **personal goals** for workouts, calories, heart rate targets, and more.
- Visualize progress over time through detailed summaries and charts.

FitTrackr is built with the philosophy that fitness is easier to maintain when all aspects of your health are tracked in a single, intuitive platform.

## Features

- **Workout Library** – Browse exercises, add custom workouts, and categorize routines.
- **Session Starter** – Track active workout metrics such as duration, heart BPM, and calories burned.
- **Nutrition Tracker** – Log meals and track calories, macros, and hydration.
- **Goal Management** – Set and monitor personal fitness targets.
- **Progress Overview** – Visual charts and summaries to track achievements over time.
- **User-Friendly UI** – Designed to be intuitive for both beginners and advanced users.

---

## Design Considerations

When designing FitTrackr, the following aspects were prioritized:

- **User Experience (UX):** Simple, intuitive interfaces that make navigation effortless.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Metrics like heart rate and calories are updated live during workouts.
- **Data Security:** Users’ personal fitness and nutrition data is stored securely.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle a growing library of exercises and user data.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensures consistent experience across devices.


---

## GitHub Integration

FitTrackr leverages **GitHub** for version control and collaborative development:

- **Repository Management:** All source code is maintained in a public/private GitHub repository for version tracking and collaboration.
- **Branching Strategy:**  
  - `main` branch: Stable production-ready code   
  - Feature branches: Individual features or bug fixes
- **Pull Requests:** All changes are reviewed through pull requests before merging into `main`.

---

## GitHub Actions

FitTrackr uses **GitHub Actions** to automate development workflows:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically builds and tests the app whenever code is pushed to `main`.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Deploys stable versions to production or staging environments automatically after passing all tests.
- **Code Quality Checks:** Linting, formatting, and unit tests are executed to maintain high code quality.

## AI Use

AI Tools Used
ChatGPT for Image Generation
ChatGPT was used to generate visual assets for the FitTrackr Android fitness application. This included:
•	Creating the main app logo and icon (icon_fitness.png)
•	Generating navigation icons for the bottom navigation bar
•	Designing vector graphics for UI elements and visual components
Cursor IDE for Code Debugging
Cursor IDE with AI assistance was used throughout the development process to:
•	Debug Android code issues and errors
•	Provide code suggestions and corrections
•	Assist with Kotlin syntax and Android framework integration
•	Help with navigation implementation and UI component development
These AI tools were used as development assistants to support the creation of the fitness tracking application, helping with both visual design elements and technical implementation challenges.
