Introduction 

 

Living a healthy lifestyle in the 21st century requires effective monitoring of physical activity, diet, and wellness habits. With the digital transformation around us, fitness tracking apps have emerged as essential tools for individuals who want to improve their health, track workouts, monitor diet, and set fitness goals. These apps provide users with a clear overview of their daily activities, automate health data collection through sensors and wearables, and offer services such as calorie counting, sleep tracking, and goal setting. 

For this research, three of the most popular fitness apps on the Android OS are examined, namely Google Fit, Samsung Health, and MyFitnessPal. Each app will be evaluated in terms of its features, strengths and weaknesses, and innovative offerings. A comparison will then highlight their differences and similarities, followed by an analysis of the best features to integrate into an ultimate fitness app. The results are intended to provide a detailed assessment of these tools to guide the development of our own fitness tracker app.

Daily activity, such as steps, Heart Points, calories burnt, distance travelled, and sleep, is highlighted on the first screen. Additionally, it tracks consistency and helps users stay motivated by displaying progress towards weekly targets, including the WHO-recommended 150 Heart Points(GSMArena.com, n.d.).  

Combining objectives and sleep insights, the second screen displays recent workouts with mapped routes, the average amount of sleep, the number of days fitness targets were met, and the regularity of the nighttime pattern. This balances tracking rest and exercise(GSMArena.com, n.d.). 

Details about sleep, such as the percentage of time spent in bed versus sleeping, the actual sleep/wake periods in relation to the schedule, and more, are displayed on the third screen. Additionally, it offers information on the quality of sleep for better rest(GSMArena.com, n.d.). 

 

Innovative Features 

 

Recommendations for activities (Move Minutes & Heart Points) based on AHA and WHO guidelines: This tool is novel because it converts international health standards into tailored, doable suggestions. By coordinating daily activity objectives with reliable medical advice, it guarantees that consumers receive advice supported by science, bridging the gap between professional advice and routine fitness choices(Graziano, n.d.). 

 

Centralised health monitoring via platform and application integration: The development of a single health dashboard is where the innovation is. In order to provide a comprehensive picture of health, the platform automatically aggregates activity, heart rate, sleep, and other parameters, eliminating the need for users to manually aggregate data from other apps or devices. Time is saved and more informed lifestyle choices are supported by this integration(Graziano, n.d.). 

 

Basic goal-driven inspiration for workout novices: This tool makes it easier for people new to fitness to start working out. Rather than confusing them with difficult programs, it offers straightforward encouragement aimed at specific goals that helps develop steady habits. By highlighting reachable targets, it increases involvement, boosts self-assurance, and supports lasting changes in lifestyle(Graziano, n.d.). 

 

 

Samsung Health Research

Personal information like steps, calories, or activities are the exclusive focus of the majority of fitness applications(Samsung.com, 2016). 

 

The app promotes responsibility and constant engagement, two important factors in sustaining long-term fitness routines, by facilitating user contact and encouragement. Users are more likely to continue with their goals when they feel part of a community that celebrates progress and offers encouragement. 

 

 

MyFitnessPal Research 

 

Overview, Description, Key Features 

 

Developer: Under Armour, Inc. 
Platform: Android & iOS 
Website: myfitnesspal.com 

 

Description: 

 
MyFitnessPal is one of the most popular apps for monitoring nutrition and caloric intake. It allows users to track macronutrients, calories, and meals in addition to exercise. Because it integrates exercise and nutrition, the program is ideal for users who want to monitor their activity and control their diets (onthegofitness, 2018). 

 

Key Features (onthegofitness, 2018): 

Database containing calorie and nutritional data for more than 14 million foods. 

For fast food logging, use barcode scanning. 

Monitors activity habits, weight, and calories burned. 

Connects to fitness applications and devices (e.g., Google Fit, Garmin, Fitbit). 

Goal setting for weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance. 

Social/community features for motivation. 

Strengths and Weaknesses 

 

Strengths (onthegofitness, 2018): 

 

Comprehensive food database with precise macro and calorie information. 

Robust interaction with third-party apps and fitness equipment. 

Promotes overall health by balancing activity and nutrition. 

The free edition has many functions, while the paid version offers more in-depth understanding. 

 

Weaknesses (onthegofitness, 2018): 

 

The premium subscription is somewhat pricey. 

The free version has irritating advertising. 

Less sophisticated activity features and a greater emphasis on diet than fitness. 

 

 

App Implementation 

 

Since MyFitnessPal places a lot of emphasis on meal tracking and nutrition, its use probably entails (Gardner, 2023):  

REST APIs: RESTful APIs are used to get the food database, which contains over 14 million items, from a central server. 

Firebase/SQLite: Meal logs that sync with the server once online are locally cached offline using Firebase/SQLite. 

Camera & Barcode API: Food product barcodes are scanned using the Android CameraX API. 

Authentication: For wide accessibility, SSO is implemented via Google, Facebook, and email sign-up. 

Cloud Sync: MyFitnessPal's servers save meal logs, exercise records, and goals, allowing data to be accessed from any device. 

Third-Party Integration: Imports workout and calorie burn data via fitness APIs (Google Fit, Fitbit, and Garmin).

On the first screen, the AI suggests a personalized meal based on the user's calorie goals, dietary needs, and health goals. Customers may choose meals without having to manually search through the whole food database, saving them time(Campbell, 2025).  

On the second screen, the nutritional details of each food item—such as calories, macros, and other crucial elements—are displayed. Because they know exactly what they are consuming, consumers are able to make informed diet choices(Campbell, 2025).  

On the third screen, users may view customized meal plans that offer a structured daily or weekly routine that varies according to their preferences. This application serves as a virtual nutrition coach, ensuring that meals stay in accordance with fitness and health objectives(Campbell, 2025). 

 

Innovative Features 

 

Fast food recording by barcode and meal scanning is innovative since it saves consumers time and effort when monitoring their meals. Instead of manually entering each food item, users may quickly monitor meals by utilizing barcode scanning or image recognition. This makes it easier to track continuously, improves accuracy, and speeds up the process—all of which are essential for successful diet management(Rebedew, 2015). 

Nutritional insights and tailored coaching stand out as revolutionary due to data-driven customization. Rather of offering broad health advice, Samsung Health customizes its suggestions based on the user's food habits, level of exercise, and wellness goals. Like if a personal trainer or dietician were included into the program, this adds interest and encouragement to the experience(Rebedew, 2015). 

 

Due to its capacity to incorporate community-driven incentive with personal health tracking, a large social network for accountability and support is revolutionary. Samsung Health turns personal wellness into a communal adventure by enabling people to interact, communicate, and support one another. This social responsibility makes the app more than simply a tracker; it turns into a fitness community by keeping users inspired, motivated, and consistent (onthegofitness, 2018).
