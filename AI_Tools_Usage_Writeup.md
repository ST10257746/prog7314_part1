- Creating the main app logo and icon (`icon_fitness.png`)
- Generating navigation icons for the bottom navigation bar
- Designing vector graphics for UI elements and visual components

### Cursor IDE for Code Debugging
Cursor IDE with AI assistance was used throughout the development process to:
- Debug Android code issues and errors
